# TextBasedGame
In the game, the player is stuck in a house with 6 rooms and has an inventory of up to 10 items. The player must move through the rooms and fight "monsters", which represent phobias. Each phobia has a particular weapon it is susceptible to and when it is defeated, the user receives a gem. Five gems are used to create the Sword of Immortality, which is the only weapon that can defeat the phobia, Death. Once death is defeated, the player has won the game and can "escape" the house.
